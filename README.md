**DESCRIPTION:**

Developed a motion-triggered alarm system using C++ and STM32 microcontrollers to enhance safety for legally blind individuals. The system integrates ultrasonic sensors for motion detection, audio output for voice instructions, and LED indicators to provide real-time alerts.

Implemented I2C communication to establish a wired connection between two STM32 microcontrollers, enabling efficient data exchange and system coordination. This project improves accessibility by offering a reliable, user-friendly solution for detecting motion and guiding users through auditory and visual cues.
